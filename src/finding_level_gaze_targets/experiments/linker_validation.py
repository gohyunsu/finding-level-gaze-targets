"""Validate the keyword-plus-negation matcher against manual annotations.

A no-match rate says nothing about how often a matched sentence is the wrong sentence, and
the patterns overlap across labels (`opacit` appears in
consolidation, effusion and atelectasis sentences; `mass` matches "mass effect"), while the
negation guard fires on any word-boundary "no", which radiology prose embeds inside positive
statements ("Stable large right pleural effusion, no significant interval change").

The REFLACX authors released ground truth for exactly this. `manually_labeled_reports_3.csv`
in ricbl/eyetracking (examples_and_paper_numbers/) gives, for 200 random Phase 3 readings and
each of the 14 findings, the character spans of every mention of that finding in the report --
produced by running a modified CheXpert labeler and then correcting it by hand. Fourteen
labels, the same fourteen we use.

Unit of evaluation is the (reading, label) pair: did the matcher find a mention, and was there
one? 200 x 14 = 2800 pairs. Sentence-level agreement is deliberately NOT attempted: their
character offsets index the report text their `extract_report.py` produced, and our sentences
come from joining the word-timestamp transcript, so offsets need not line up. Presence is the
robust unit, and it separates the two failure modes that matter -- a false
positive is a pattern that fires on the wrong finding, a false negative is a mention the
patterns or the guard threw away.

The guard is scored both ways, so how much recall it costs and how much precision it buys
are both visible.
